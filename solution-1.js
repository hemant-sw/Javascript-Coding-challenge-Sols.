// Question - Coding Challenge -1 (Jonas Schmedtmann)


/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.*/

//----------------Solution---------------------

/*const mark_Mass = 78;
const mark_height = 1.69;

const john_Mass = 92;
const john_height=1.95;*/

const mark_Mass = 95;
const mark_height = 1.88;

const john_Mass = 85;
const john_height=1.76;


const markBMI= mark_Mass/(mark_height*mark_height);
const johnBMI = john_Mass/(john_height*john_height);

console.log(markBMI , johnBMI);

const markHigherBMI =(markBMI > johnBMI);

console.log(markHigherBMI);
